# Fair Go Web - Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your development environment has been configured to work seamlessly with Claude Code.

---

## What Was Set Up

âœ… **Supabase CLI** - For generating database types
âœ… **Netlify CLI** - For deployment management
âœ… **Supabase MCP Server** - Gives Claude direct database access
âœ… **Svelte MCP Server** - Already configured for Svelte 5 help
âœ… **`.claude.md`** - Project context file
âœ… **Database types generated** - `src/lib/types/database.types.ts`
âœ… **`.mcp.json` gitignored** - Your credentials are safe

---

## Next Steps (Do these now!)

### 1. Authenticate with Netlify

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
netlify login
```

This will:
- Open your browser for authentication
- Save your credentials locally
- Allow Claude to help with deployments

After logging in, verify it worked:
```bash
netlify status
```

### 2. Link to your Netlify site

```bash
cd /Users/dickjones/project-local/fair-go-web
netlify link
```

Choose your existing Fair Go site from the list.

### 3. Restart Claude Code

**IMPORTANT**: The Supabase MCP server won't activate until you restart Claude Code.

After restart, the MCP server will load and I'll be able to help you with:
- Database queries and schema inspection
- Table creation and modifications
- Data analysis
- All without you leaving the chat!

## Testing in Your New Session

After restarting Claude Code, try these to verify everything works:

### Test 1: Supabase MCP (Database Access)
Ask Claude:
> "Show me all the tables in my database"

Claude should be able to query your Supabase database directly and list tables like `authors`, `carousel_items`, etc.

### Test 2: Supabase Type Generation
Ask Claude:
> "Regenerate my Supabase types"

Claude should run:
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --project-id cejoaoqhphkhwbdagzib > src/lib/types/database.types.ts
```

### Test 3: Netlify CLI
Ask Claude:
> "Check my Netlify deployment status"

Claude should run `netlify status` and tell you about your site.

### Test 4: Svelte MCP
Ask Claude:
> "Show me the Svelte 5 documentation for $state"

Claude should fetch the official Svelte 5 runes documentation.

## Common Workflows

### When you change the database schema:
1. Make changes in Supabase dashboard (or ask Claude to help via MCP)
2. Ask Claude: "Regenerate my database types"
3. Claude runs the type generation command automatically
4. Use the new types in your code

### When you want to deploy:
Ask Claude:
> "Deploy to Netlify preview"

Claude will run `netlify deploy` for you.

### When you need database info:
Instead of opening Supabase dashboard, just ask Claude:
> "What columns are in the authors table?"
> "Show me the last 5 news articles"
> "Create a new table for campaign events"

## Troubleshooting

### MCP server not working?
1. Make sure you restarted Claude Code
2. Check `.mcp.json` has valid credentials (no "YOUR_" placeholders)
3. Try running `supabase gen types` manually to verify credentials work

### Netlify commands failing?
1. Make sure you ran `netlify login`
2. Make sure you ran `netlify link` to connect to your site
3. Try `netlify status` to verify authentication

### Types generation failing?
1. Check your Supabase project ID is correct in `.claude.md`
2. Verify you have internet connection
3. Check Supabase is not having an outage

## Pro Tips

1. **Ask Claude to help with schema changes** - No more switching to the web dashboard
2. **Use the type generation frequently** - After every schema change
3. **Let Claude handle deployments** - Just ask "deploy to production"
4. **Reference `.claude.md`** - It has all the project context Claude needs
