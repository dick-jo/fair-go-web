# Security Audit Report - Fair Go Web

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Auditor**: Claude (Automated Security Review)

---

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **VERDICT: YOUR SECRETS ARE SAFE!**

After a comprehensive security audit, **you did everything correctly**. Your secrets are properly protected and not exposed to the client.

---

## Audit Findings

### ‚úÖ 1. Environment Variables (SECURE)

**Found in `.env`:**

- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - ‚úÖ Safe (public by design)
- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - ‚úÖ Safe (protected by RLS)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - ‚úÖ Protected (server-only)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - ‚úÖ Protected (server-only)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - ‚úÖ Protected (server-only)

**Analysis:**

- Proper use of `PUBLIC_` prefix for client-safe variables
- Dangerous keys (service role, Stripe secrets) have NO prefix
- `.env` is gitignored and was never committed to git history

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Server/Client Separation (SECURE)

**Secrets are ONLY used in server files:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN (found in all your files)
import { STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY } from '$env/static/private'
```

**Files using secrets:**

- `src/routes/api/stripe-webhook/+server.ts` ‚úÖ
- `src/routes/api/donate/+server.ts` ‚úÖ
- `src/routes/api/create-membership-checkout/+server.ts` ‚úÖ
- `src/routes/api/create-donation-checkout/+server.ts` ‚úÖ
- `src/routes/api/cancel-subscription/+server.ts` ‚úÖ
- `src/routes/(private)/private/membership/+page.server.ts` ‚úÖ
- `src/routes/(general)/donate/success/+page.server.ts` ‚úÖ

**All are server-side files** (`+server.ts` or `+page.server.ts`) using `$env/static/private`.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Build Output (SECURE)

**Client bundle (`build/_app/immutable/`):**

- ‚úÖ Contains ONLY the public anon key (safe)
- ‚ùå NO service role key found
- ‚ùå NO Stripe secret keys found
- ‚ùå NO webhook secrets found

**Example from build:**

```javascript
const I = 'https://cejoaoqhphkhwbdagzib.supabase.co/',
	i = 'eyJ...anon...' // This is the PUBLIC anon key - safe!
```

This JWT decodes to `"role":"anon"` which is protected by Row Level Security (RLS).

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Netlify Secret Scan (RESOLVED)

**What happened:**

1. You deployed to Netlify
2. Netlify's secret scanner found environment variables in **server-side build output**
3. This is **expected and safe** for SvelteKit server-side rendering
4. Secrets are in `/.netlify/server/` and `/.svelte-kit/output/server/` - these run on Netlify's servers, NOT in browsers

**Your fix (in `netlify.toml`):**

```toml
[build.environment]
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS = ".netlify/server/**,.svelte-kit/output/server/**"
```

‚úÖ **This is the CORRECT solution!**

The scanner was being overly cautious. Server-side code on Netlify's infrastructure is safe to contain secrets.

---

## Understanding the Security Model

### What's Safe to Expose (Client-Side)

**Supabase Anon Key:**

```typescript
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJ...role:anon...'
```

- ‚úÖ Designed to be public
- ‚úÖ Protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
- ‚úÖ Can only access data allowed by RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Cannot bypass RLS or access admin functions

**Supabase URL:**

```typescript
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = 'https://yourproject.supabase.co'
```

- ‚úÖ Public endpoint
- ‚úÖ All requests authenticated via anon key or user JWT

### What MUST Stay Secret (Server-Only)

**Supabase Service Role Key:**

```typescript
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = 'eyJ...role:service_role...'
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bypasses ALL Row Level Security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Full admin access to database
- ‚úÖ YOU: Only used in server-side code

**Stripe Secret Key:**

```typescript
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'sk_test_...'
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can create charges, refunds, access customer data
- ‚úÖ YOU: Only used in server-side code

**Stripe Webhook Secret:**

```typescript
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = 'whsec_...'
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Verifies webhook authenticity
- ‚úÖ YOU: Only used in server-side webhook handler

---

## How SvelteKit Protects You

### Import from `$env/static/private`

```typescript
import { STRIPE_SECRET_KEY } from '$env/static/private'
```

SvelteKit **guarantees**:

1. These variables are NEVER bundled into client JavaScript
2. They only exist in server-side code
3. Build will fail if you try to use them in client components
4. They're injected at build time into server bundles only

### Import from `$env/static/public`

```typescript
import { PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL } from '$env/static/public'
```

SvelteKit behavior:

1. These ARE bundled into client JavaScript (safe)
2. Available in both server and client code
3. Must be prefixed with `PUBLIC_`

---

## Netlify Deployment Security

### Where Secrets Live

**On Netlify's servers:**

```
/.netlify/server/       <- Contains your server code with secrets
                           (runs on Netlify infrastructure, not browsers)
```

**Sent to browsers:**

```
/build/_app/immutable/  <- Contains ONLY public variables
                           (safe to expose)
```

### Your Netlify Environment Variables

These are injected at build time:

- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ‚Üí Available everywhere (safe)
- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` ‚Üí Available everywhere (safe)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` ‚Üí Server-only (protected)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` ‚Üí Server-only (protected)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` ‚Üí Server-only (protected)

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Things You're Already Doing Right

1. **Using SvelteKit's `$env/static/private`** for all secrets
2. **Gitignoring `.env`** and never committing it
3. **Using Netlify environment variables** for production
4. **Adding `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS`** to netlify.toml
5. **Keeping secrets in server files only** (`+server.ts`, `+page.server.ts`)
6. **Using `PUBLIC_` prefix** for client-safe variables

### üìã Optional Best Practices

#### 1. Rotate Test Keys Before Production

Your `.env` shows test keys (`sk_test_...`). Before going live:

```bash
# Replace with production keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
```

#### 2. Consider Supabase RLS Policies

Since you're using the service role key to bypass RLS in webhooks, make sure:

- RLS is enabled on all tables
- Anon key users can only access their own data
- Admin operations go through authenticated API routes

#### 3. Monitor Stripe Webhook Security

Your webhook handler verifies signatures (line 27 of webhook file):

```typescript
event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signature, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
```

‚úÖ This is correct! Keep this verification in place.

#### 4. Add Rate Limiting (Future Enhancement)

Consider adding rate limiting to:

- Donation checkout endpoints
- Membership checkout endpoints
- Prevent abuse of your Stripe integration

---

## Common Pitfalls (You Avoided!)

### ‚ùå WRONG (You didn't do this):

```typescript
// Don't hardcode secrets
const stripe = new Stripe('sk_test_hardcoded_key')

// Don't import secrets in client components
// src/lib/components/MyComponent.svelte
import { STRIPE_SECRET_KEY } from '$env/static/private' // Build error!

// Don't commit .env to git
git add .env  // Never do this!
```

### ‚úÖ RIGHT (What you did):

```typescript
// Import from private env
import { STRIPE_SECRET_KEY } from '$env/static/private'

// Use only in server files
// src/routes/api/+server.ts
const stripe = new Stripe(STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)

// Gitignore .env
// .gitignore contains: .env
```

---

## Testing Checklist

Want to verify everything yourself? Run these checks:

```bash
# 1. Verify .env is gitignored
git check-ignore .env
# Should output: .env

# 2. Verify .env was never committed
git log --all --full-history -- .env
# Should be empty

# 3. Search build for secrets (should find nothing dangerous)
grep -r "sk_test_\|sk_live_\|whsec_\|service_role" build/_app/immutable/

# 4. Verify only public variables in client bundle
grep -r "PUBLIC_" build/_app/immutable/
# Should find PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY only
```

---

## Conclusion

**You can relax!** üéâ

Your implementation follows security best practices. The Netlify secret scan warning you saw was a false positive - it detected secrets in **server-side** build output, which is expected and safe for SSR frameworks like SvelteKit.

**What you did right:**

- ‚úÖ Used `$env/static/private` for secrets (SvelteKit's protection)
- ‚úÖ Kept secrets in server-only files
- ‚úÖ Configured Netlify to ignore server-side secrets
- ‚úÖ Never committed `.env` to git
- ‚úÖ Used proper PUBLIC\_ prefixing

**The "frontend monkey" is now a security-conscious full-stack dev!** üöÄ

## Questions?

If you're ever unsure, ask Claude:

- "Are my secrets safe in this file?"
- "Audit my code for security issues"
- "Should this variable be PUBLIC\_ or private?"
